**IEx** stands for "Interactive Elixir." It is Elixir's interactive shell, providing a way for developers to interactively run Elixir expressions and get immediate feedback. This REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop) tool is beneficial for experimenting with Elixir code, debugging, and understanding the language better.

### Key Features and Uses of IEx:

1. **Interactive Code Execution**: Developers can type any valid Elixir expression into IEx and see the result immediately, making it a powerful tool for experimentation and learning.

2. **Built-in Help**: By typing `h` followed by a function name, you can access documentation directly from the shell. For instance, `h Enum.map/2` would show you the documentation for the `Enum.map/2` function.

3. **Autocompletion**: IEx offers autocompletion for module names, functions, and even documentation. Pressing the `Tab` key will provide suggestions based on the current input.

4. **History**: Navigate through previously executed commands using the arrow keys.

5. **Runtime System Information**: IEx allows developers to get runtime information about the system, applications, and processes.

6. **Breakpoints and Debugging**: With tools like `IEx.pry`, developers can set breakpoints in their code and inspect variable values, call functions, and more, all within an interactive session.

7. **Mix Integration**: When combined with Mix (Elixir's build tool), you can start IEx with the context of your Mix project loaded using the command `iex -S mix`. This loads your entire project and its dependencies into the session, allowing you to interactively work with your project's modules and functions.

8. **Customization**: You can customize the behavior and appearance of IEx by setting specific configurations, such as colors, prompts, and more.

9. **Shell Commands**: Execute shell commands directly from IEx by prefixing them with the `cmd` command, e.g., `cmd ls`.

10. **Multiline Input**: IEx supports multiline input, allowing for the definition and testing of more complex functions and data structures right in the shell.

### Starting IEx:

To start an IEx session, simply type `iex` in your terminal if you have Elixir installed. This will initiate the interactive shell, where you can begin typing Elixir expressions.

In summary, IEx is an indispensable tool for Elixir developers. Whether you're new to the language and want to experiment, need to debug a complex problem, or want quick access to documentation, IEx provides an interactive and user-friendly environment to enhance your Elixir development experience.
